# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Steve, a recent Finance Degree graduate, has his first client, his parents. They are passionate about green energy. They want to invest in alternative energy. They have chosen DAQO New Energy Corp, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Steve would like for them to diversify their funds. 

Steve has hired me to assist him with analyzing stock market data. I used VBA in Excel to provide Steve with an automated means for analyzing any stock market data. I have provided him with a macro enabled workbook that contains two worksheets. One of an analysis of the DQ stock his parents want to invest in. The second performs an analysis of all of the stock in his data set.
